                        <h2>Let the Darkness Fall</h2>
                        <p>Recital is pleased to publish the first vinyl edition of Let the Darkness Fall, 
                            a forgotten corner from the vast discography of Suzanne Langille & Loren Connors. 
                            Joined here by David Daniell and Andrew Burnes (of the Atlanta-based group San Agustin), 
                            Darkness was recorded in the summer of 1998 on a Tascam Porta-5 in Loren and Suzanne's Brooklyn living 
                            room, and issued the following year as a limited CD by Secretly Canadian. <br><br>

                            The tender gloom of Let the Darkness Fall sounds like a broadcast of some private séance. 
                            The trio of guitarists here show a beautiful restraint, hovering just underneath vocalist 
                            Suzanne Langille's ephemeral poetry. Once they hit RECORD, the sensitivity of the players 
                            melded this quartet into a sole-entity; finishing each other's phrases in slow motion. Suzanne's 
                            gentle voice glows through the wispy guitar shadows with a quiet determination. One could almost 
                            imagine her building a nest out of the guitar lines she's gathered. <br><br>
                            
                            This collection of musicians is a precursor to the band Haunted House, a wild sort of jam-band 
                            playing the blues without playing structure. Recital is proud to continue the series of 
                            Loren Connors-related editions, stretching from his art books Wildweeds & Night of Rain, 
                            to his masterpiece solo LPs Airs & Lullaby. And Recital is equally thrilled to highlight 
                            Suzanne Langille’s mystifying command of voice and word and the intricate guitar work of 
                            Andrew Burnes and David Daniell. Come revisit the mist that filled that living room 25 years ago.
