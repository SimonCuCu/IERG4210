A Record Shopping Website
By Chengbo HUANG, Simon, 1155173827

I. Introduction:

--> index.html
    The home page of the shopping website. 

--> category folder
    Includes the category.html, which is the relevant category page.

--> image folder
    Includes all the image sources.

--> product_detail folder:
    Includes the product_detail.html, which is the page showing the detail information of a product.

--> style.css
    The css file includes all the style formats.

--> script.js
    Currently no contents.

II. Remark:
    
    1. Currently the js file is empty as it's not required to implement javascript functions. As a result, some buttons in the website, like checkout button and add to cart button, are just for display and has no functions. The function is to be implemented in the future.
    2. As there is no function currently, the items in the shopping cart are manually input and are just for display. So is the inventory low function.
